I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.
